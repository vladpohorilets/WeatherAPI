- **Hosted API**: [weatherapi-trt0.onrender.com](https://weatherapi-trt0.onrender.com/)
- **Swagger**: [weatherapi-trt0.onrender.com/docs](https://weatherapi-trt0.onrender.com/docs)
- **Example Request**: [weatherapi-trt0.onrender.com/api/weather?city=Rivne](https://weatherapi-trt0.onrender.com/api/weather?city=Rivne)

- **Demo HTML Page**: [vladpohorilets.github.io/WeatherFrontend/](https://vladpohorilets.github.io/WeatherFrontend/)
- **Demo HTML Page code**: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/vladpohorilets/WeatherFrontend/blob/main/index.html)

> **Note**: The `.env` file with database credentials is intentionally included to allow you to test the database connection (via DataGrip, for example). This project is hosted on a separate GitHub account for security purposes.

> **Known Issue**: Gmail's anti-spam system automatically follows all links in emails, which can cause automatic confirmation of subscriptions. The API works perfectly with other email providers like Proton Mail. Changing to POST requests would fix this, but that would require modifying the swagger specification.

## Running locally:

## Implemented Features

I tried to implement all the requirements that were given, maybe I missed something small, but the project still implements absolutely all the points of the task 

- **Weather Data Endpoint**: GET `/api/weather?city={city}` - Retrieves current weather for a specified city, including temperature, humidity, and weather description.

- **Confirmation Endpoint**: GET `/api/confirm/{token}` - Confirms email subscription via token sent in the confirmation email.
- **Unsubscribe Endpoint**: GET `/api/unsubscribe/{token}` - Allows users to unsubscribe from weather updates using a token included in each weather update email.
- **Full API Documentation**: Available via Swagger UI at the `/docs` endpoint.
- **Bonus Features**:
  - Deployed API on Render hosting
  - Simple HTML subscription page
